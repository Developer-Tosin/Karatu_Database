# Karatu_Database

## 🚀 Project Overview

You will:
1. **Design and Implement a Relational Database**  
   Create tables for `customers`, `products`, `orders`, and `order_items` using SQL, ensuring proper normalization and relationships between entities.
   
2. **Perform CRUD Operations**  
   Use SQL commands to create, read, update, and delete data in the database.

3. **Query for Analytical Insights**  
   Write SQL queries to answer business questions, such as:
   - Which products generate the most revenue?
   - Who are the top customers based on total spending?
   - What are the monthly sales trends?

4. **Demonstrate Optimization Techniques**  
   Improve query performance by using indexing, query restructuring, and other optimization techniques.

## 📋 Project Requirements

1. **SQL Database Management System**  
   Use any RDBMS like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite.

2. **Database Schema**  
   The database schema includes:
   - **Customers**: Customer information (e.g., `id`, `name`, `email`, etc.).
   - **Products**: Product details (e.g., `id`, `name`, `price`, etc.).
   - **Orders**: Order metadata (e.g., `id`, `customer_id`, `order_date`, etc.).
   - **Order_Items**: Items in an order (e.g., `id`, `order_id`, `product_id`, `quantity`, etc.).

3. **Sample Data**  
   Populate the database with sample data for testing queries and analysis.

4. **SQL Queries**  
   Write and document SQL queries for:
   - Basic operations (CRUD).
   - Analytical insights (e.g., revenue, customer behavior).
   - Optimization techniques.
